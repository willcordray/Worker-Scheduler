Program Purpose:
---------------

    Automates the process of scheduling workers into timeshifts. The tool first 
    creates a valid schedule based on the number of workers needed per shift 
    and availability, then optimizes for considerations like workers' shift 
    preferences, double shifts, and preferred coworkers.

Compile/run:
-----------

    Compile command: "make" (should work across platforms)

    Run Command:
       "./workerscheduler [directory of worker input files] (optional: --seed=)"


Usage:
-----
    See file include/SchedulerData.h to define the desired schedule, 
    as well as change the user defined values.


    Penalties and Bonuses:
        User Defined Values: double shift penalty (two shifts in a row), 
                             double day penalty (two shifts in one day), 
                             coworker preference bonus.

        All priorities (the desirability of the shift to the worker) are 
        normalized from 0 to 1, and the penalties / bonuses apply to these 
        normalized values. For example, a penalty of 2 is equivalent to two 
        shifts going from the highest priority to the lowest
    

    Search Priority:
        User Defined Values: proportion of final score from the average 
        happiness of the workers, the happiness of the least happy worker, 
        and the range between the most underbooked and most overbooker worker.

        Order of Importance:
            1. Ensure all shifts have the correct number of workers.
            2. Evenly distribute shifts among workers relative to their desired 
               number.
            3. Maximize worker happiness considering shift desirability and 
               any penalties or bonuses.

        The program performs multiple searches and selects the best result 
        based on the defined proportion constants.
    
    
    Miscellaneous notes:
        Worker names must be unique, and spaces are allowed
