Program Purpose:
---------------

    The purpose of OH scheduler is to schedule workers to shifts (though it can 
    easily be generalized), with a focus on creating the most desirable 
    schedule using worker happiness with that shift, distribution of the number 
    of shifts per worker, and user defined constants for things like penalties and 
    bonuses for characteristics about a schedule.

Compile/run:
-----------

    Compile command: "make"

    Run command: "./workerscheduler [directory of worker input files] (optional: --seed=)"


Usage Notes:
-----------
    Penalties and Bonuses:
        all priorities (the desirability of the shift to the worker) are 
        normalized to 1 (with the highest priority being 1, and the lowest 
        being 0), and these penalties / bonuses apply to these normalized 
        values. For example, a penalty of 2 is equivalent to two shifts 
        going from the highest priority to the lowest
    
    Priority ranges:
        all the priority levels for shifts should be positive and the Program
        works best when the range between the highest priority and the lowest
        priority is less than 1,000 (though there is no hard restriction)
    
    Search Priority:
        In order of importance when creating a schedule, the program fills all
        shifts with the correct amount of workers (guaranteed), make sure all workers
        are evenly distributed with the number of shifts relative to their
        desired number of shifts (not technically guaranteed, but rarely fails),
        and finally maximize the "happiness" of the workers accounting for 
        their desirability for the shift, as well as any penalties and bonuses.

        The main program runs the search multiple times and selects the best
        result, based on the proportion constants (average happiness, lowest 
        happiness, distribution of shifts).
    
    Miscellaneous notes:
        Worker names must be unique, and spaces are allowed
        the file workerLikes.txt contains all the worker pairings, and is a reserved filename // TODO: try to remove this restriction
